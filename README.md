Sealevel rise became a serious threat to assets located in areas (islands or parts of countries) directly exposed to seas and oceans.
Why? Because people didn't expect such rapid climate change and sea level rise as we have seen in recent years. Therefore, valuable assets have been built on these threatened areas.
This optimization project tries to solve this problem by finding cost-effective sets of places where we should place barriers against potential flooding.
